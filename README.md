# Instagram Post Automation Script  

ðŸ“¸ Automate the process of posting your photos to Instagram using the **Google Drive API**, **Instagram API**, **ChatGPT**, and **GitHub Actions**.  

## Features  
- **Seamless Integration**: Monitors a Google Drive folder for new photos.  
- **Smart Caption Generation**: Uses ChatGPT to generate engaging captions for each photo.  
- **Automated Posting**: Posts photos directly to Instagram, complete with captions.  
- **Tracking System**: Maintains a record of already posted photos to avoid duplicates.  
- **Scheduled Execution**: Uses GitHub Actions to periodically run the script.

## How It Works  
1. **Upload Photos**: After editing, upload your photos to a designated Google Drive folder.  
2. **Photo Check**: The script identifies photos that havenâ€™t been posted yet, using a tracking file.  
3. **Processing**: New photos are downloaded, resized to Instagramâ€™s media requirements, and prepped for posting.  
4. **Caption Creation**: ChatGPT generates captions to accompany the photos.  
5. **Posting**: The photos are automatically uploaded to Instagram, and the tracking file is updated.  
6. **Automation**: The entire process is scheduled using GitHub Actions to run at regular intervals.
